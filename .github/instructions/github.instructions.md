# Tag Release Instruction (GitHub)

Whenever you are going to create (release) a new tag on GitHub (repository tags/releases), you must first check the latest tag that was released. Inform the user of the current (latest) tag and suggest the next tag version before proceeding with the release. This ensures versioning is clear and avoids accidental duplicate or skipped versions.
